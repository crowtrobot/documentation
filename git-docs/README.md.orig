# Intro

This is just a place for me to publish some notes / guides I've written. Mostly just things I've learned trying things out in my home lab. A lot of these pages are things I've moved here from other locations as I've been trying to find a system I like for making these available.   This means that these aren't going to be in any specific order. &#x20;
