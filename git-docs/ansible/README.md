# Ansible

If you want to get started with Ansible, I think the best way to go is to get some hands-on with some basic Ansible functions, and then expand out from there.  So, this is going to start with a quick-start bare-minimum to get ansible to work on your workstation, managing one server.  Hopefully this creates a foundation to work with. &#x20;
