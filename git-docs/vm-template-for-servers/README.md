# VM Template for servers

I've written a few pages about how I build a VM template, and how I deploy it.  These are a bit disjointed, but I am going to try to unify them a bit as sub-sections under this topic. &#x20;



I have for a while been playing with ansible, planning to be able to deploy some of the VMs in my home lab with it. The basic goal is to be able to replace a VM like the nginx reverse proxy quickly and easily.  These pages describe the process. &#x20;
