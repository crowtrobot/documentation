# Root in LUKS Volume

It seems I lost the page about installing with the root volume in LUKS.  A lot of distributions offer as an option during installation, so the page was a bit outdated anyway. &#x20;

See [https://github.com/cornelinux/yubikey-luks](https://github.com/cornelinux/yubikey-luks) for an easy tool for using a yubikey to unlock your LUKS volume on boot.  It would be a good idea to have a backup key, or a long backup password stored safely in case something happens to your yubikey. &#x20;
